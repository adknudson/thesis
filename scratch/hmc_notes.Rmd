The full details of `Stan`'s HMC algorithm is described in the Stan reference manual.

One benefit of using HMC over other samplers like Gibbs sampling is that HMC offers diagnostic tools for the health of chains and the ability to check for _divergent transitions_ (discussed in \@ref(model-checking)).
