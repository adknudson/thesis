\section*{Abstract}

A common neuroscience topic is to determine the temporal order of two stimuli, and is often studied via a logistic model called a psychometric function. The data arises from repeated sampling of subjects across a variety of tasks (stimuli), blocks, and time separations. These studies are often interested in making inferences at the group level (age, gender, etc.) and at an individual level. This hierarchical nesting makes multilevel modeling a natural choice for these data. We describe a principled workflow for model development using domain expertise, regularizing priors, and posterior predictive performance to compare models. We then apply the workflow to produce a novel statistical model for temporal order judgment data by fitting a series of Bayesian models efficiently using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) in the R programming language with Stan.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my advisor and mentor Dr. Grant Schissler for his dedicated support and optimism. Grant introduced me to a new world of probability and statistics, and helped foster my growing interest in computational statistics and data science. I am also grateful to the graduate school representative, Dr. Fang Jiang, for her support and the opportunity to work with her in the Psychology department. Her work became the basis for my Masters thesis, and showed me that statistics is relevant in all corners of scientific research. To Dr. Colin Grudzien, for his great support and taking the time to make suggestions. A special thanks goes to Dr. Anna Panorska. She has played a considerable role in my academic career, first as my professor introducing me to statistics, then later by supporting my entry to the graduate program, and finally as the graduate director for the statistics and data science program. Her encouragement in no small part helped me to finish my degree. I would like to acknowledge my family's support, especially my sister, Heather, who has been very understanding during my most stressful times. Finally I am thankful to all the faculty members, graduate students, and staff in the department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Nevada.
