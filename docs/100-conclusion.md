The real story of developing this psychometric model (the one here and not in the workflow section) is more revealing of the real struggles of performing data analysis than the principled workflow would let on. Often I found myself putting in vast amounts of unnecessary work - but necessary for me to do in order to realize that it is unnecessary - just because I hadn't yet learned what the likely paths to take were. On a more personal level, my struggles were not ever really in developing a model or coding it up - in fact I could tinker with a program for hours, improving it in this way or that. For me, programming was a puzzle and an art, and I internalized the idea that I could figure out any numerical task given enough time and focus. To the contrary, I believed that writing was a chore, that writing this thesis would be like trying to dam up all the deltas in an attempt to keep the main river on course.

I think of learning mathematics as learning a puzzle game. The first few puzzles are easy, but then get progressively harder. But even as the puzzles get harder, your intuitive understanding of the game improves, and you can throw away the obviously poor moves from consideration, and try paths that are more likely to move you in the direction of the correct solution. I started my journey towards obtaining a Master of Science in Statistics precisely because I knew that I could obtain a more intuitive understanding of the quantitative world that I live in, and pick up some new tools along the way to create and solve more impressive puzzles.
