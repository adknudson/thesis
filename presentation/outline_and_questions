    - `av-post1-O-f-CE`
    - Complete separation in the data
- model background
  - First intuition is to reach for simple GLM
  - Why not use mixed effects model (lme4)?
  - What is used in place of these?
  - Why is Bayesian modeling cool?
  - What's the downside of Bayesian?
  - How is it done?
  - Now what?
    - Build a model
- psych model
  - What's the best way to develop a model?
  - Selecting priors
  - Iteration 1 (base model)
  - Iteration 2 (adding age and block)
  - Iteration 3 (adding age-block interactions)
  - Iteration 4 (adding a lapse rate)
  - Iteration 5 (adding subjects)
- results
  - On perceptual synchrony
  - On temporal sensitivity
  - On lapse rates
  - On individuals
- discussion
  - Experimental design







- Grant's questions
  - How would you build a model that analyzes all 4 task at once?
  - Most researchers would put these data into a single level glm() or a random effects glm() and use classical statistical significance testing. Besides the complete separation, how do your results compare to that approach? would age group "matter" universally? How can your model further science more appropriately?
  - Did you consider treating age as a continuous? How would that change your model? Is it a good idea?
  - Give a few ideas how would you use these data and models to move from prediction/association to causal inference.
  - Please expand on your experimental design discussion. How many subjects should be included if there is a follow-up study? What SOAs to pick? What tasks to focus on?
  - How sensitive are your results to choice of psychometric function?


- Fang's Questions
  - Why should I bother with this method over simple glm?
