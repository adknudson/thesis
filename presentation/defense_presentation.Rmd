## Introduction


- Began my Masters by taking _Intro to Statistical Computing_ with Dr. Schissler
- Asked if there were any projects that I could become involved with
- Had the opportunity to work with psychometric data provided by Dr. Fang
- Initially started as a data cleaning project that turned into modeling and analysis
- While cleaning the data, I had to learn the details of the experimental setup and the deeper theory


## What are psychometrics?


- Psychometric experiments allow us to examine the response between the world around us and our inward perceptions
- Biological and contextual factors influence the integration/segregation of multisensory signals
- A psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable
- When the temporal delay between stimuli grows large enough, the brain segregates the two signals and the temporal order can be determined


## Some more background


- The range of temporal delays for which sensory signals are integrated into a global percept is called the temporal binding window
- Perceptual synchrony is the temporal delay between two signals at which an observer is unsure about their temporal order
- The ability to discriminate the timing of multiple sensory signals is referred to as temporal sensitivity
- A deficit in temporal sensitivity may lead to a widening of the temporal binding window


## Temporal order judgment tasks {.smaller}

- 
- **Audiovisual** task asks observers if they perceived an audio stimulus before a visual
- **Visual** task asks observers if the right visual stimulus came before the left
- **Duration** task asks observers if lower a circle on a screen was presented longer than an upper circle
- **Sensorimotor** task asks observers if a visual stimulus on a screen came before they pressed a button


```{r multitask-table}
set.seed(4)
multitask %>%
  filter(trial %in% c("pre", "post1")) %>%
  select(-rid) %>%
  group_by(task) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 1) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


_I use "positive" and "negative" to refer to "yes" and "no" responses respectively_


<div class="notes">
A temporal order judgment task is a type of psychometric experiment where participants are asked to determine the temporal order of two stimuli separated by a temporal delay.

There are four different TOJ tasks within this study that explore the relationship between different sensory signals.

```{r ground-truth}
tibble(
  Task = c("Audiovisual", "Visual", "Sensorimotor", "Duration"),
  `Positive Response` = c("Perceived audio first", 
                          "Perceived right first", 
                          "Perceived visual first",
                          "Perceived bottom as longer"),
  `Positive SOA Truth` = c("Audio came before visual",
                           "Right came before left",
                           "Visual came before tactile",
                           "Bottom lasted longer than top")
) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
</div>




## Temporal recalibration


- Perceptual synchrony and temporal sensitivity can be modified through a baseline understanding
- To perceive events as simultaneous, our brains adjust for differences in temporal delays of transmission
- The perception of simultaneity can be modified by repeatedly presenting the stimuli at fixed time separations (called an adapter stimulus) to an observer
- This repetition of presenting the adapter stimulus is called temporal recalibration


## Experimental motivation


- Does age have an affect on the temporal binding window?
- Does temporal recalibration affect the temporal binding window?

- The temporal binding window is described by two measures
  - **Point of subjective simultaneity** (PSS) which is a measure of perceptual synchrony
  - **Just noticeable difference** (JND) which is the smallest lapse in time so that a temporal order can just be determined

```


$$

$$


## Three ways to visualize the observed data {.smaller}


```{r three-plots-same-data, fig.height=3.75}
p1 <- visual %>%
  filter(trial == "pre") %>%
  ggplot(aes(soa, response)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()

p2 <- visual %>%
  filter(trial == "pre") %>%
  ggplot(aes(soa, response)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.05) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw()

p3 <- visual_binomial %>%
  filter(trial == "pre") %>%
  mutate(p = k / n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(soa, p)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.05) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(y = "response proportion")

(p1 | p2 | p3) + plot_annotation(title = "Three plots, same data",
                                 subtitle = "Visual Task - Pre adaptation")
```


- Transparency better shows the density of "positive" responses at different temporal delays
- Can aggregate repeated measures for temporal delays into Binomial counts
- Proportion can be derived from aggregated Binomial counts


## Data quirks {.smaller}


```{r data-quirks, fig.height=3.5}
pl <- audiovisual_binomial %>%
  filter(rid == "av-post1-O-f-CE") %>%
  mutate(p = k / n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(soa, p)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.9) + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of responses vs. Temporal delay",
       subtitle = "Record ID av-post1-O-f-CE",
       x = "stimulus onset asynchrony (ms)",
       y = "response proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  theme_bw()

pr <- visual_binomial %>%
  filter(rid == "vis-pre-Y-m-CB") %>%
  mutate(p = k / n) %>%
  ggplot(aes(soa, p)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.9) + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of responses vs. Temporal delay",
       subtitle = "Record ID vis-pre-Y-m-CB",
       x = "stimulus onset asynchrony (ms)",
       y = "response proportion") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  theme_bw()

pl | pr
```


- (Left) record for `av-post1-O-f-CE` removed from data set
- (Right) some subjects in the visual task have exceptional performance (approaching perfect separation)


# Modeling the Psychometric Function


## Why not use a simple GLM? {.smaller}


```{r fit-glm, echo=TRUE}
glm_subject_level <- glm(response ~ 0 + sid + sid:soa,
  family = binomial("logit"), data = visual,
  subset = trial %in% c("pre", "post1"))
```


```{r glm-estimates}
high_std_err = c("Y-m-CB", "M-m-BT")
broom::tidy(glm_subject_level) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(term, paste(high_std_err, collapse="|"))) %>%
  separate(term, into = c("sid", "soa"), sep = "\\:") %>%
  mutate(soa = if_else(is.na(soa), "(Intercept)", "soa"),
         sid = str_remove(sid, "sid")) %>%
  select(sid, soa, estimate) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = sid, names_from = "soa", values_from = estimate) %>%
  mutate(`pss (ms)` = -`(Intercept)` / soa,
         `jnd (ms)` = qlogis(0.84) / soa) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```


<br />


- Easy to use and fit in `R`
- Necessary to drop one of the categorical levels
- Estimating confidence intervals for psychometric properties requires bootstrap methods
- Near perfect separation results in unreliably large standard errors


## Mixed effects models {.smaller}


```{r fit-glmer, echo=TRUE}
library(lme4) # linear mixed effects
glmer_subject_level <- glmer(
  response ~ 1 + soa + (1 + soa | sid),
  family = binomial("logit"), data = visual,
  subset = trial %in% c("pre", "post1"))
```


```{r glmer-estimates}
coef(glmer_subject_level)$sid %>% as_tibble(rownames = "sid") %>%
  filter(sid %in% high_std_err) %>%
  mutate(`pss (ms)` = -`(Intercept)` / soa,
         `jnd (ms)` = qlogis(0.84) / soa) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```


<br />


- Can model the fixed effects shared across all groups and the group (random) effects
- Levels with less information are shrunk towards the fixed parameter estimate
- More "reasonable" estimates of the just noticeable difference
- Cannot incorporate prior information
- Not flexible enough to model more complex psychometric features like lapse rates


## Enter Bayesian statistics


$$
\pi(\theta | data) = \frac{\pi(data | \theta) \pi(\theta)}{\int_\Omega \pi(data | \theta) \pi(\theta) d\theta}
$$


- Bayes' Theorem is a simple rearranging of conditional probability
  - $P(A|B) = P(A \cap B) / P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)/P(B)$
- The prior $\pi(\theta)$ is some distribution over the parameter space
- The likelihood $\pi(data | \theta)$ is the probability of an outcome in the sample space given a value in the parameter space
- The denominator is the average likelihood of the data over the parameter space
- The posterior $\pi(\theta | data)$ is our updated belief of the distribution of the parameter


## Easy in theory, difficult in practice


$$
\pi(\theta | data) = \frac{\pi(data | \theta) \pi(\theta)}{\int_\Omega \pi(data | \theta) \pi(\theta) d\theta}
$$


- The denominator is a constant scale factor that ensures $\pi(\theta|data)$ is a proper probability distribution
  - We often say that the posterior is proportional to the prior times the likelihood: $\quad \pi(\theta | data) \propto \pi(\theta) \times \pi(data | \theta)$
- Often the integral in the denominator is complex or of a high dimension
- A solution is to use **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC) simulations to draw samples directly from the posterior distribution


## Hamiltonian Monte Carlo


- Markov Chain Monte Carlo constructs a sequence of proposal points from a target distribution
  - Points are accepted or rejected based off of some criterion
- **Hamiltonian Monte Carlo** (HMC) tracks the position of a "particle" following frictionless Hamiltonian dynamics
  - The particle is imparted with a random direction and kinetic energy
  - Effective sampling of high-dimensional probability spaces
  - Has greatly reduced pointwise autocorrelation compared to simpler MCMC
  - Requires evaluating the gradient at each step

# Building a Model for the Psychometric Function | Using a Principled Bayesian Workflow


## What is a Principled Bayesian Workflow?


- A method of employing domain expertise and statistical knowledge to iteratively build a statistical model 
- Satisfies the constraints and goals set forth by the researcher
- Four questions to evaluate a model by
  - Domain Expertise Consistency
  - Computational Faithfulness
  - Inferential Adequacy
  - Model Adequacy


<div class="notes">
**Domain Expertise Consistency** - Is our model consistent with our domain expertise?

**Computational Faithfulness** - Will our computational tools be sufficient to accurately fit our posteriors?

**Inferential Adequacy** - Will our inferences provide enough information to answer our questions?

**Model Adequacy** - Is our model rich enough to capture the relevant structure of the true data generating process?
</div>


## The Workflow in Brief {.smaller}


<div class="columns-2">


![](../figures/workflow-diagram.png){width=100%}


- Pre-model, pre-data
  - conceptual analysis
  - observation space
- Post-model, pre-data
  - Turn conceptual analysis and observational space into a mathematical model
  - Check prior-predictive distribution against domain knowledge
- Post-model, post-data
  - Fit the observed data to the model
  - Perform posterior predictive checks
- Iterate


</div>


## Pre-workflow considerations


- Psychometric properties inform modeling choices
  - Point of subjective simultaneity and just noticeable difference are estimated from the psychometric function
  - We have prior information about the PSS and JND
- We have control over:
  - Choice of psychometric function
  - Choice of linear parameterization
  - Choice of priors


## Choice of psychometric function


<div class="columns-2">


```{r pf-assortment, fig.width=4.5}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-6, 6), y = c(0, 1)), aes(x, y)) +
  stat_function(aes(linetype = "Logistic"), fun = plogis) +
  stat_function(aes(linetype = "Gaussian"), fun = pnorm) +
  stat_function(aes(linetype = "Weibull"), 
                fun = pweibull, args = list(shape = 3)) +
  labs(title = "Assortment of Psychometric Functions") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(0.17, 0.75))
```

- Logistic and Gaussian have no skewness
- Gaussian puts predictor on standard (probit) scale
- Logistic puts predictor on log-odds (logit) scale
- Logistic is the "canonical" choice for Binomial regression
- We use the logistic function:

$$
F(\theta) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\theta)}
$$


</div>


<div class="notes">
The logistic distribution has heavier tails, which often increases the robustness of analyses based on it compared with using the normal distribution

By rewriting the Bernoulli PMF in exponential family form, the natural parameter, $\theta$, is $\theta = \log(p/(1-p))$
</div>


## Choice of linear parameterization {.smaller}


The **point of subjective simultaneity** and **just noticeable difference** are defined as


$$
\begin{align*}
pss &:= F^{-1}(0.5; \alpha, \beta) \\
jnd &:= F^{-1}(0.84; \alpha, \beta) - F^{-1}(0.5; \alpha, \beta)
\end{align*}
$$


"Slope-intercept" linear parameterization


$$
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \alpha + \beta x
\Longrightarrow
\begin{split}
pss &= -\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \\
jnd &= \frac{\mathrm{logit}(0.84)}{\beta}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
$$


"Slope-location" linear parameterization


$$
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \beta (x - \alpha)
\Longrightarrow
\begin{split}
pss &= \alpha \\
jnd &= \frac{\mathrm{logit}(0.84)}{\beta}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
$$


## Selecting priors - Point of subjective simultaneity


- The point of subjective simultaneity can be either positive or negative
- Some studies suggest that the separation between stimuli need to be as little as 20ms for subjects to be able to determine temporal order
- Other studies suggest that our brains can detect temporal differences as small as 30ms
- We should be skeptical of PSS estimates larger than say 150ms in absolute value
- $$pss \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \Longleftrightarrow \alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2)$$


## Selecting priors - Just noticeable difference


- It is impossible that a properly conducted block would result in a just noticeable difference less than 0
- Also unlikely that the just noticeable difference would be more than a second
- Some studies show that an input lag as small as 100ms can impair a person’s typing ability
- The log-normal distribution is a convenient choice for the just noticeable difference
- Choose prior so that $median[\textrm{JND}] \approx 0.100$ and $P(\textrm{JND} < 1) \approx 0.99$
  - $$jnd \sim \mathrm{Lognormal}(-2.3, 1^2)$$
  - $$\beta = \frac{\mathrm{logit}(0.84)}{jnd} \Longleftrightarrow \beta \sim \mathrm{Lognormal}(2.8, 1^2)$$
  

## Defining the observational space


- The response that subjects give during a temporal order judgment task is recorded as a zero or a one
  - $y_i \in \lbrace 0, 1\rbrace$
- If the stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are fixed then we have repeated measurements for each SOA and the responses can be aggregated into Binomial counts
  - $k_i, n_i \in \mathbb{Z}_0^+, k_i \le n_i$
  - $k_i \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i)$


## Iteration 1 - baseline model


In the language of math


<div style="font-size: 14pt;">
$$
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    k_i &\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
    \mathrm{logit}(p_i) &= \beta \cdot (x_i - \alpha) \\
    \alpha &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\
    \beta &\sim \mathrm{Lognormal}(3, 1^2)
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
$$
</div>


In the language of `Stan` 

<div style="margin: auto; width: 35%; text-align: left;">
```
model {
  vector[N] p = beta * (x - alpha);
  alpha ~ normal(0, 0.06);
  beta ~ lognormal(3.0, 1.0);
  k ~ binomial_logit(n, p);
}
```
</div>


## Prior distribution of psychometric functions


```{r prior-pf}
set.seed(124)
n <- 10000
a <- rnorm(n, 0, 0.06)
b <- rlnorm(n, 3.0, 1)

p <- data.frame(x = c(-0.5, 0.5), y = c(0, 1)) %>% ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  labs(x = "SOA", title = "Prior distribution of psychometric functions") +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
for (i in 1:100) {
  p <- p +
    geom_function(fun = fn, args = list(a = a[i], b = b[i]),
                  color = "steelblue4", alpha = 0.25)
}

p + theme_bw()
```


## Iteration 2 - adding age and block categories


Three ways to add a categorical variable


$$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \mu_\alpha &= \alpha_{trt[i]} \\
    \alpha_{trt} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2)
  \end{split}
\qquad
  \begin{split}
    \mu_\alpha &= \alpha_{trt[i]} \\
    \alpha &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\
    \alpha_{trt} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\alpha, \sigma_{trt}^2) \\
    \sigma_{trt} &\sim \pi_{\sigma}
  \end{split}
\qquad
  \begin{split}
    \mu_\alpha &= \alpha + \alpha_{trt[i]} \\
    \alpha &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 0.06^2) \\
    \alpha_{trt} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{trt}^2) \\
    \sigma_{trt} &\sim \pi_{\sigma}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
$$


- (Left) Categorical variable replaces the intercept so each level explicitly gets its own intercept
- (Center) Each categorical variable is modeled as having the same mean and standard deviation that is learned from the data (centered multilevel)
- (Right) Same as center, but using the non-centered parameterization
  - Most convenient when adding multiple categorical variables


## Using the non-centered log-normal parameterization


$$
\begin{align*}
X &\sim \mathcal{N}(3, 1^2) \\
Y &= \exp\left(X\right) \Longleftrightarrow Y \sim \mathrm{Lognormal(3, 1^2)}
\end{align*}
$$


Adding categorical variables to the slope term is more tractable


$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
k_i &\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &= \exp(\mu_\beta) (x_i - \mu_\alpha) \\
\mu_\alpha &= \alpha + \alpha_{trt[i]} + \alpha_{G[i]} \\
\mu_\beta &= \beta + \beta_{trt[i]} + \beta_{G[i]} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
$$


## Iteration 2 - Checking the posterior {.smaller}


```{r load-posterior}
m042 <- readRDS("../models/m042.rds")
m042nc <- readRDS("../models/m042nc.rds")

pars <- c(
  "a", "b", 
  "aG", "bG",
  "aT", "bT",
  "sd_aG", "sd_bG",
  "sd_aT", "sd_bT",
  "pss", "jnd")

cp_neff <- bayesplot::neff_ratio(m042, pars = pars)
ncp_neff <- bayesplot::neff_ratio(m042nc, pars = pars)
```


```{r posterior-checks, fig.width=10, fig.height=3.5}
p_trace <- bayesplot::mcmc_trace(m042nc, pars = c("a", "b"), 
                                 facet_args = list(ncol=1))

p_ncp <- bayesplot::mcmc_neff(ncp_neff) + 
  labs(title = "Non-centered Parameterization")
p_cp <- bayesplot::mcmc_neff(cp_neff) + 
  labs(title = "Centered Parameterization")

p_trace | (p_cp / p_ncp)
```


- (Left) trace plot shows that Markov chains are "healthy"
- (Right) Autocorrelation between samples reduces the effective sample size
  - Non-centered parameterization allows for more efficient exploration of the posterior


## Iteration 3 - modeling age-block interactions {.smaller}


- There is a problem with the previous model
  - It measures the average difference in blocks, and the average difference in age groups
  - Does not consider any interaction between the two
  - Model assumes that temporal recalibration affects all age groups the same
- Modeling interactions between categorical variables by creating a new categorical variable
  - If $G$ has levels $\{\textrm{young}, \textrm{middle}, \textrm{older}\}$ and $B$ has levels $\{\textrm{pre}, \textrm{post}\}$, then the interaction variable $C=G\times B$ will have levels 
  

$$
G = \begin{bmatrix}
\textrm{young} \\
\textrm{middle} \\
\textrm{older}
\end{bmatrix}, B =  \begin{bmatrix}
\textrm{pre} \\
\textrm{post}
\end{bmatrix}\Longrightarrow G\times B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\textrm{young-pre} & \textrm{young-post} \\
\textrm{middle-pre} & \textrm{middle-post} \\
\textrm{older-pre} & \textrm{older-post}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

```


- The subject either experiences a lapse in judgment with probability $\gamma$ or they do not
- If there is no lapse, they will give a positive response with probability $\pi=F(x)$
- If there is a lapse in judgment, then it is assumed that they will respond randomly
- The probability of a positive response is the sum of the two paths:


$$
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{P}(\textrm{positive}) &= 
  \mathrm{P}(\textrm{lapse}) \cdot \mathrm{P}(\textrm{positive} | \textrm{lapse}) \\
  &\quad + \mathrm{P}(\textrm{no lapse}) \cdot \mathrm{P}(\textrm{positive} | \textrm{no lapse}) \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \gamma + (1 - \gamma) \cdot F(x)
\end{align*}

## Model Assessment

- Domain Expertise Consistency
  - The model does not predict anything that conflicts with domain expertise
- Computational Faithfulness
  - Posterior samples are reliable as determined by posterior checks
    - Trace plots, split $\hat{R}$, $N_{\textrm{eff}}/N$ ratio, divergent transitions
- Inferential Adequacy
  - Modeling age and block interactions allows us to answer questions about age and temporal recalibration
- Model Adequacy
  - Modeling a lapse rate is more true to the data generating process, and improves predictive performance

## Improving psychometric experiments


- The results here are based on small-scale preliminary data
- There is an inherent difficulty for the different tasks
  - Visual < Audiovisual < Duration < Sensorimotor
  - Indicated by temporal sensitivity and lapse rates
- Lapses should be independent of the task
  - Distribution of lapse rates across ages and tasks shows this assumption is violated
  - Better estimation of lapse rates by presenting larger SOAs in the experiment
- In the visual TOJ task, the granularity in the SOA values near the PSS could be increased to get more reliable estimates of the slope and to avoid complete separation
