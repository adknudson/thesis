## Introduction


- A common neuroscience topic is to detect the temporal order of two stimuli
- These studies are often interested in making inferences at the group level and at an individual level
- 


## Classical methods



## Bayesian statistics

# Methods

# Background to Pyschometrics

## Psychometric experiments

## Temporal order judgment tasks

## Baseline model

## Adding age and block

## Modeling interactions

## Incorporating a lapse rate

## Adding subjects

# Results

## On temporal sensitivity

## On perceptual synchrony

## Lapses

## Subject level predictions

# Discussion

## Improving psychometric experiments
